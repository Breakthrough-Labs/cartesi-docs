:::note
To test stake delegation on the Ethereum Ropsten testnet, youâ€™ll need some Ropsten ETH and Ropsten CTSI. There are multiple Ropsten ETH faucets, [this one gives 5 Ropsten ETH](https://faucet.dimensions.network/). You can get **Ropsten CTSI** at [this simple faucet](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x0F3D7Dbaf7125885D8dd80dA4327feF54A030fe5#writeContract) by connecting your metamask wallet and executing the requestTokens method.
