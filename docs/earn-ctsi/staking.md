## Prerequisites

First, you need to have [Metamask installed](https://metamask.io/download/) or other crypto wallets such as Ledger, Coinbase wallet or using WalletConnect.

To test stake delegation on the Ethereum Goerli testnet, you will need to have some ETH Goerli  and Goerli CTSI. Use [Alchemy faucet](https://goerlifaucet.com) to get 0.2 ETH Goerli. You can get **Goerli CTSI** at [this simple faucet](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xc3779fE5E6246fF6dBFEd09904788abC9063037E#writeContract) by connecting your Metamask wallet, clicking on **Connect to Web3**, and then executing the method **requestTokens** by clicking on the **Write** button.
